ff is a CLI to command the firefox browser. You can get a list of commands
and options with the `help` command. Start the browser with:

	$ ff --port 2929 start

You can open an URL with the `go` subcommand

	$ ff --port 2929 go www.google.com

Finally you can close the browser with the `quit` command

	$ ff --port 2929 quit

The `--port` option is not always convinient, the environment variable `FF_PORT` can be used instead.
