ff is a CLI to command the firefox browser. You can get a list of commands
and options with the `help` command. Start the browser with:

	$ ff --port 2929 start

You can open an URL with the `go` subcommand

	$ ff --port 2929 go www.google.com

Finally you can close the browser with the `quit` command

	$ ff --port 2929 quit

The `--port` option is not always convinient, the environment variable `FF_PORT` can be used instead. If it is set
the option is not needed

	$ ff start

##  Getting page information

To get the source of the current wepage use the `source` command

	$ ff go google.com
	$ ff source

Likewise for the title and url

	$ ff title
	$ ff url

There are also commands to inspect web content. For example to print out all the text content for paragraph tags in
a page, use the text command

	$ ff text p

Some elements may be empty, you can skip those with the option `--skip-empty`

	$ ff text --skip-empty p

The attr command is similar but gets the value in a named html attribute, for example to get the href attribute for
all anchors

	$ ff attr --skip-empty a href
