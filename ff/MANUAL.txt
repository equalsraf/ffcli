ff is a CLI to command the firefox browser. You can get a list of commands
and options with the `help` command. Start the browser with:

	$ ff --port 2929 start

You can open an URL with the `go` subcommand

	$ ff --port 2929 go www.google.com

Finally you can close the browser with the `quit` command

	$ ff --port 2929 quit

The `--port` option is not always convinient, the environment variable `FF_PORT` can be used instead. If it is set
the option is not needed

	$ ff start

##  Getting page information

To get the source of the current wepage use the `source` command

	$ ff go google.com
	$ ff source

Likewise for the title and url

	$ ff title
	$ ff url

There are also commands to inspect web content. For example to print out all the text content for paragraph tags in
a page, use the text command

	$ ff text p

Empty elements are not printed.

The attr command is similar but gets the value in a named html attribute, for example to get the href attribute for
all anchors

	$ ff attr a href

The property command is very similar to attr, however properties are JSON values. Strings are quoted, and null
values are ignored.

	$ ff property html scrollWidth
	1907

## Windows/tabs

You can list the browser windows using the windows command

	$ ff windows
	8 "Google"
	14 "New Tab"

The id can be used with the switch command to switch tabs.
